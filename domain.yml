  utter_define_stock:
  - text: "A stock or share (also known as a company's equity) is a financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation and
          represents a proportionate claim on its assets (what it owns) and earnings (what it generates in profits).﻿﻿
          Stock ownership implies that the shareholder owns a slice of the company equal to the number of shares held as a proportion of the company's
          total outstanding shares. For instance, an individual or entity that owns 100,000 shares of a company with one million outstanding shares would
           have a 10% ownership stake in it. Most companies have outstanding shares that run into the millions or billions."

  utter_start_trading:
  - text: "To start trading in share market or stock market in India, you need a Demat and trading account. Demat and trading accounts in India are
          provided by the two depositories, NSDL and CDS, through brokerage firms, also known as stock brokers or share brokers.
          The trading account is where you will place bids for buy or sell orders and demat account is for holding your shares in dematerialized form.
          The trading of shares in Indian stock market takes place on two stock exchanges-the Bombay stock exchange(BSE) and the National stock exchange
          (NSE)."

  utter_stock_market:
  - text: "Buying a share or stock of a company simply means you are buying a unit of the company. Investors are able to buy the stocks of the company
          once the company share is launched in the market.
          Share is a unit of ownership of a company and is offered for sale in the market when a company needs to raise money for further growth.
          The shares in the market are launched in the form of initial public offering (IPO). The price of IPO of a company is decided based on how much
          the company is estimated to be worth, and how many shares are being issued. The company gets to keep the money raised to grow its business,
          while the shares or stock of the company continue to trade on an exchange, such as the NSE and BSE.
          In stock market, a company gets only the amount collected through IPO launch. The money from buying or selling of the stock of the company on the
          exchanges is not received by the company. Investors gain or lose money in market depending on the perceived value of company."

  utter_no_stocks:
  - text: "Your portfolio should not be over or under diversified. Do not invest all your money in a single stock as it increases the risk in your portfolio.
          Diversify your portfolio by purchasing multiple stocks from different industries.
          In general, you should not buy more than 8-10 stocks as it becomes really difficult for a retail investor to monitor more stocks. Besides,
          over-diversification kills the profit."

  utter_stock_returns:
  - text: "Your stock portfolio will always consist of multiple stocks. At any particular time, some stocks will perform excellently well, while some will not.
          Your portfolio returns will be the average of both.
          During a good market, your portfolio can give you a return as high as 30-35%.However, during a bad market- the returns can be as low as 2-5%
          (maybe even negative).
          If you sum up everything, you can expect an annual return of 15-18%, depending on how good you were at picking stocks. Nevertheless, you can
          generate even better return if you are ready to put some hard work."

  utter_avoid_stocks:
    - text: "You should avoid investing in stocks with low liquidity. There are a number of small-cap stocks where the prices may be continuously falling,
            but the investors are not able to sell that stock just because there are no buyers.Avoid investing in companies with low liquidity.
            Further, for the beginners- I would also advise avoiding investing in penny stocks. These companies are very risky and prone to different
            scams like pump and dump etc."

  utter_bse_nse:
    - text: "BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) and NSE (National Stock Exchange) are among two largest stock exchanges in India where shares of move then 5000
            companies are traded. In simple term BSE / NSE provides a platform for investors to buy and sell the listed company shares."

  utter_demat:
    - text: "A demat account is mandatory since the credit of shares granted to you will be shared in this account."

  utter_bottoming_out:
    - text: "Bottoming out is the phase when stock falls downwards to it's lowest peak and is expected to reach to rise in the coming days.This phases seems
            as profitable by the investors as the stock is expected to rise rapidly."

  utter_corona:
  - text: "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus, or COVID, is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.The disease has since spread worldwide,
            leading to an ongoing pandemic.
            Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,cough, headache,fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.
            Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.
            Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected
            person.Those particles may be inhaled or may reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition
            (i.e. being coughed on).

  utter_risk_corona:
    - text: "People of any age, even children, can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous
            symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older at the highest risk of serious symptoms. In the U.S., about 80% of deaths from
            the disease have been in people age 65 and older. Risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions."
